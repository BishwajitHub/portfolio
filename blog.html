                     okay Let's start Hello! I greeting üôè you I‚Äôm <strong>Bishwajit jha</strong>, 
          B.Tech student in Computer 
          Science & Technology, currently i am in<strong> (3rd sem) second year</strong> at 
          <strong>Shivaji University, Department of Technology, Kolhapur,
             Maharashtra-416004</strong>. As you all know that there is no every person had his 
              journey of life with full of excitement but some of was his difficulty 
              in their life of journer so <strong>I  am the one of them </strong>because of my 
              family which is not to much strong , what ever my father is suffering from the 
              health issues, which make him weak and also us, let leave it .<br>

              <strong>we all have to know that every steps of persons who grow up, they faced with some
               difficulty, challenges, setback, and failure.</strong> Such that, if we want to make statue of any 
               things like god or persons by stone , We should first break these stone by  hammer and chisel
                if these stone weep or say not to break me with hammer and chisel these stone never be
                 a better statue. So, if we make success in our life we feel all the challenges and setback.
               

                 A persons who developed themselves they have to cross all the challenges are like the
                  parts of body they inevitable in faces of their life journey, at a time
                  
                  at the previous grade like (NG-7) i am not that much good in my studies.
                  when I studied in class 8 (Eight), i know every things & focus in my study
                  from that time i was Better in my study my dream was to be  Computer Engineer. 
                  but because of my father condition make my family so, weak and sad
                  All my friends and neighbour told me that I  couldn't complete my
                   study because I was  from  low medium family and also your father
                    got sick so, their is no any source of money. At that time no
                     one notices my pain, tears, and sadness, they all noticed my 
                     family mistake So,I know I don't waste my time with explanation
                      to the people  because the people only hear what they want to hear.
                       I don't care what other people think about me, Ionly concentrate in 
                       my study this makes my result better in class 10 board exam and
                        I passed with (3.96/4 GPA) mark .

                        Hence, I want to started my Grade 11 &12 from Kathmandu best college.
                         I gave entrance in so many science collages, I have got scholarship 
                         in that collages for only study I have not stay their my family has
                          financial problem to kept me at that place for study. I knew the
       situation of my family & returned back my home since, I join the government collage for
        +2 level at my village with computer science and  I passed Grade -11 with 91 % mark .

I remember one things in my mind, if I want to be successful, respect
 this one rues <strong>"Never lies myself and Never loss my hope in myself"</strong>.
  Success is not a key to happiness, only happiness is the main key 
  to be success in life. However I  faced with challenges and setback 
  with sadness my mother told me  to keep 3 words alwways
   in my pocket i.e. Try, True and Trust means Try-for better future, 
   True-with your work and Trust-in god, then success will be in your life.

I have only my family to support in my study no other at that time my 
father don't do any work. All the family pressure is on my head so, I think ,,
 i better to go slow in the right direction but I don't go fast in 
 the wrong direction because I am only one person that take care of
  my family in the future time. When I spend my one-one day for my better future, I don't
   think about that day i.e. yesterday, only I think about tomorrow
    because tomorrow is a chance to correct the mistake of yesterday.

    I wearing unbranded and cheap clothes in my birthday and school & collage
     function because I have no money to buy a better clothes but I
      know clothes doesn't means that I  am poor i have my family to feed
       and see my future aim not to impress community. Life is not a
        game of luck, it's true if i want to win, work hard in my life, 
        I never feel sad about losing any things in life because every
         things is correct according to the time, such that <strong>"a tree
          loses a leaf, a new leaf grows in it place. </strong>My family and 
          time teach me, how to face the challenge, difficulties,
           setback and failure? I don't underestimate myself, no matter
            what people told. According to my hard labour
             I passed my Grade -12 with 90 % mark... </p>


 <p>I was fortunate to receive the <strong>ICCR scholarship</strong>,
           which gave me the opportunity to pursue my dreams of studying  B.TECh in computer at India.
            Adjusting to a new city, culture, and academic environment was not easy,
             but it pushed me to grow, become independent, and embrace new experiences.
              From the first day, I focused on building a strong foundation in programming,
               computer fundamentals, and technology.</p>

<p>During my first year, I started exploring <strong>web development and frontend
           projects</strong>, including my <strong>personal portfolio website</strong>,
            where I could showcase my skills and projects. Each small project taught me 
            important lessons in coding, design, and problem-solving. Beyond academics,
             I actively participate in extracurricular activities like <strong>cricket</strong>,
              where I have achieved success, winning the 
               which taught me teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>

               <p>Being in a new city and university also helped me develop life skills‚Äîtime
           management, self-learning, and adapting to a different environment. I am 
           now looking forward to learning more advanced programming concepts,
            taking on bigger projects, and sharing my journey through my blog. 
            Every project completed, every challenge faced, and every lesson 
            learned is a step forward in my journey as a developer and as a person.</p>





         <p>now,at this days  My journey has been full of excitement, learning, and adaptation.
           I come from <strong>Nepal</strong> to my dream places so, i you trust on yourself that means <strong>Dream comes True</strong> </p>

       
            <P>CONCLUSION:
In the conclusion I learn from my past that if I didn't face this type of problem I couldn't
 get focus in study. I realized every things is good which have done by the god, while more 
 difficulties, challenges and setback comes in my life but, I can't stop my study finley, 
 I am just one step back¬†of¬†my¬†dream¬†¬† i.e best Datascientist at Microsoft companyüëç</P>
