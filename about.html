                <P> I also better have basic knowledge With CSS,add cool effects like gradient text, smooth hover animations, and box shadows for depth. Using border-radius makes rounded corners, while flexbox helps center elements easily & also create a sticky header, adjust opacity for transparency, and control layers with z-index. These small skills make websites look modern and interactive.</P>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <P>A useful Python skill is working with list comprehensions, which let you create lists in a single line instead of writing long loops. Another handy skill is using f-strings for clean and easy string formatting. You can also handle large amounts of data with dictionaries and sets, which make searching and organizing faster.</P>
